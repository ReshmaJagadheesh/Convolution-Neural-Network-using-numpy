Implement CNN from scratch using numpy

A single layer CNN(1 hidden layer) with filter size 3*3 and five channels was implemented using Numpy to train MNIST data.
The model attained an accuracy of 96% in three epochs. SGD was used for model optimization. ReLU and Softmax (fully connected NN activation functions were used.
