Implement CNN from scratch using numpy

A single layer CNN(1 hidden layer) with filter size 3*3 and number of channels = 5 is implemented using Numpy from scratch to train MNIST data.
The model attained an accuracy of 96% with just three epochs. SGD was used for model optimization. Activation fuction- ReLU and Softmax (fully connected NN)
